<h3>My work include developing all the frontend contents</h3>
<p>I’m an Indianapolis native - born and raised in India. I have started my career as a Test Engineer with Fossil Corporation It was a US based retail watch manufacturing industry. Where I gained knowledge on the Testing life cycle then moved to
  Finishline, Inc where I have been in multiple portfolios that include, Point of Sale, Supply chain, order management & Inventory Management. When I’m not working on a project you can usually find me playing cricket, going out for long rides. I’m
  very excited to be here at Specialized and am looking forward to working with you!
